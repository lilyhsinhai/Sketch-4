# Sketch-4
 
**ToDo**
- [x] create a grid of quilt sections (images)
- [x] crop and add my 25 images
- [x] add a mousePressed function
	- [x] when you click on a tile, that tile repeats across the whole screen
	- [x] the tiles repeat in different rotations
- [x] add a mouseMoved function
	- [x] when the mouse moves, reset the tiles so they can click another one
- [x] make it so when the mouse is hovering over a tile it's highlighted (maybe a translucent white square over top)
